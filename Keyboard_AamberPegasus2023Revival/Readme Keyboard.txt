Note:
The keyboard has provision for a Power LED and a Cassette Data LED, there is no provision on the V1.0 Mainboard for these however 
some inovative wiring connecting the mainboard LEDs to the keyboard cable could enable these functions if required.

The 8x diodes can be any schottkey diode, I used 1N5819 as I had a lots but they are a bit larger than required.


The keyswitches are Cheery 5-pin, I have included links to the ones I used.
The spacebar doesnt have a stabiliser, I just added extra switches at either end which seems to work ok.

There is a link to the keycaps I used, be careful if substituting that the non-alphanumerical keys of longer than one keyswitch size 
are the correct length AND the position of the switch attachment is in the same location.
